# 🎬 Movie Booking App — UI/UX Design (Figma)


## 📖 Overview  
*Movie Booking App* is a concept *UI/UX design project* built to reimagine how users book movie tickets on mobile devices.  
The design focuses on creating a *seamless, **visually engaging, and **user-friendly* experience with a cinematic look and feel.

This project was created as part of my design learning journey and marks my *first mini UI project* in Figma.
